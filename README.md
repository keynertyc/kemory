# KEMORY

KEMORY GAME is a fun and challenging memory game inspired by the classic memory game. The unique feature of KEMORY GAME is that it generates random images using the "Google Custom Search API" based on the topic entered by the user. The game consists of a 4x4 grid of cards, and players need to match pairs of cards with the same image to win the game. The number of movements taken to complete the game is displayed on the screen.

4. Click on a card to flip it and reveal the image. Remember the position of each image.
5. Click on another card to flip it and reveal the image. If the two images match, they will remain face up. Otherwise, they will be flipped back face down.
